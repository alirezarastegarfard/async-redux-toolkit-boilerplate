# Async Redux Toolkit Boilerplate

This project is a simple demonstration of state management using **Redux Toolkit**. It explores the core concepts of Redux Toolkit, such as:

- `createSlice`
- `createEntityAdapter`
- `getSelectors`
- `createAsyncThunk`
- Reducers and extra reducers

The project implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a normalized state structure managed by `createEntityAdapter`.

## Features

- **Fetch Users**: Fetches a list of users from a placeholder API.
- **Add Users**: Adds a new user to the list.
- **Edit Users**: Updates the name of an existing user.
- **Remove Users**: Deletes a user from the list.
- **Sorted State**: Automatically sorts users alphabetically by name using `sortComparer`.

## Key Concepts

### 1. `createEntityAdapter`

- Simplifies managing normalized state.
- Provides utility functions like `setAll`, `addOne`, `updateOne`, and `removeOne`.
- Includes built-in `getSelectors` to derive data from the state.

### 2. `getSelectors`

- Provides prebuilt selectors like `selectAll` and `selectById`.
- Used to fetch users or a specific user from the Redux state.

### 3. `createAsyncThunk`

- Handles asynchronous logic like fetching data from an API.
- Automatically handles pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.

### 4. Reducers and Extra Reducers

- **Reducers**: Handle synchronous state updates.
- **Extra Reducers**: Listen for actions outside the slice, such as actions generated by `createAsyncThunk`.

## Usage

1. **Fetch Users:**
   When the app loads, it fetches users from a placeholder API using `createAsyncThunk`. The data is normalized and stored using `createEntityAdapter`.

2. **Add a User:**
   Enter a name in the input field and click "Add User". A new user is added with a unique ID.

3. **Edit a User:**
   Click "Edit" next to a user, update the name in the input field, and save the changes.

4. **Remove a User:**
   Click "Remove" next to a user to delete them from the list.

## Example API Used

The project uses [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as the fake API to fetch users.

API Endpoint: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
